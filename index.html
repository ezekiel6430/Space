        <h1>About Space</h1>
        <p>Space is really cool there are lots of cool facts about space</p>
        <h1>About our solar and other things near it</h1>
        <p>    </p>
        <h1>The Sun</h1>
        <p>The Sun is the thing that holds our solar system</p>
        <p>together. If we didn't have the sun we would be dead</p>
        <p>because we need sunlight to live. </p>
        <p>Sunlight takes eight minutes to travel</p>
        <p>so that means we wouldn't notice the sun was gone</p>
        <p>until eight minutes is up.</p>
        <p>The Sun will blow up in about 7 billion years</p>
        <p>but don't worry that is a long time from now.</p>
