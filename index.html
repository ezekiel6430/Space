         <p>such as astroids, comets and so much more!</p>
         <h1>The Sun</h1>
         <p>The sun is 98% of the mass of the entire solar system</p>
         <p>The sun is the thing that holds our solar system</p>
         <p>together. If we didn't have the sun we would be dead</p>
         <p>because we need sunlight to live. </p>
         <p>Sunlight takes eight minutes to travel</p>
         <p>so that means we wouldn't notice the sun was gone</p>
         <p>until eight minutes is up.</p>
         <p>The sun will blow up in about 7 billion years</p>
         <p>but don't worry that is a long time from now.</p>
         <p>The surface of the sun is 9369°F that's hot 🥵</p>

         <p>3. Space is a hard vacuum, meaning it is a void containing very little matter.</p>
         <p>4. There is no sound in space because molecules are too far apart to transmit sound.</p>
         <p>5. The space between galaxies is not completely empty but has an average of one atom per cubic meter.</p>
         <p>6. There are an estimated 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. </p>
